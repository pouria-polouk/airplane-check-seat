What the project does?
This program, written in Python, is designed to check the seats of an airplane before the flight. (In each airplane, there are several rows, and each row contains multiple seats. For example, seat 5B refers to the fifth row and seat B in that row). Any seat that has an issue can be identified.  
After running the program, an Excel file must be selected from the disk (by clicking on "Excel File..."), and the names of airline companies can be added (by clicking on "Add Company"). Then, for each selected airline, defective seats can be marked, and the results can be saved in the Excel file (by clicking on "Save Change"). The date of the last modification will also be recorded in the file.  
This is a graphical-based project developed using the flet module. However, the pandas, numpy, and openpyxl modules are also used for reading from and writing to the Excel file.

Why the project is useful?
It streamlines the inspection and reporting process for airplane seat conditions, enabling faster and more accurate management. The graphical interface and standardized data storage (Excel files) improve productivity for technical and service teams in airline companies.
